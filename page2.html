  <h3> Early Life and School : </h3>
  <p2> I have been going to JCS since Kindergarten. I have played soccer my whole time I have been here. I played basketball since I was in second grade and stopped playing in seventh grade. I have two siblings that both graduated from here. I was born in
    kentucky but moved to Jackson when I was very young. I plan to go to college after I graduate in get a degree in engineering. I do not currently have a college I know that I want to go to yet. </p2>
